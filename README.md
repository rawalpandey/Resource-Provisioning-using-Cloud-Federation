### Concept of Development/Abstract: 
Cloud Computing is the state of the art
computation paradigm enabling providers to offer computing resources to
customers in a pay-per-use fashion.
To avail these services, traditionally users need to choose a vendor which
provide cloud services and register themselves with that vendor for some
specified charges. The vendors takes data from the user with the assurance
of keeping their data secure at their servers.
The only problem with this system is increased number of attacks at such
data centers and risk of losing all the data at once from a single place.
Today,when most companies rely hugely on their database for their business
and some companies that run entirely on their rich database, loss as such
can prove to be disastrous and fatal for such companies.
One of the solution to this problem is to avoid the storage of complete data
a single place.
So, the idea is to create a platform where user will ask just for the amount
of resource they need and need not be the concerned about the vendor. The
platform will decide and divide the data equally across different vendors or
across different servers within a vendor.
This will reduce, if not prevent the loss of data in case of attack on vendor.


### Introduction: 
Nowadays public Cloud providers offer similar services within few
service models, mainly IaaS and PaaS. Cloud providers give to the user the
feeling to dispose of infinite resources, thus having to predict the user
requirements in order to provide services with minimal costs, maintaining
at the same time high levels of SLAs. In order to achieve this goal, Cloud
providers can cooperate together to bring new business opportunities, such
as expanding available resources, achieving cost effective asset
optimization and adopting power saving policies. Cloud Federation allows
different Cloud providers the opportunity to work collaboratively to offer
best services to customers and contemporary to improve their productivity.
Customers can advantage from Cloud Federation for a larger offer of
available services, the capability of price comparison and the removal of
vendor lock-in. In this paper we describe a platform that enables the
federation of several heterogeneous Cloud Providers to allow the customers
choosing and activating Cloud services from a central platform, bringing
more attractive price policy to customers.
